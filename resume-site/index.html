		<h2>Who is Matt O'Reilly?</h2>
		<p>Before I dive into my skills, education, and experience, I'd like you all to know a little bit about who I am.</p> 

		<p>To start, I'm a 23 year old marketer who was born and raised in Long Island. After four incredible years at James Madison University, I returned to Long Island to work in Manhattan.</p>

		<p>I would say that I have a wide variety of interests. These interests include, but are not limited to: all things sports (kind of a walking sports encyclopedia), music (anywhere from Creedence Clearwater Revival to Kendrick Lamar), staying fit, and compelling television shows such as: Game of Thrones, Narcos, and South Park. I'm a very sociable person who loves a good night out, and I'd like to think I have a good sense of humor as well.</p>

		<p>I believe that I can bring a lot of value to your organization. When I am enthused and can identify with a brand on a personal level, I will work tirelessy to communicate all the benefits your organization can provide through social media, blog posts, SEO, or any other medium you'd like to use. Additionally, I have an analytical side, and I enjoy digging through the results of campaigns in order to learn what has worked, and what hasn't. Don't believe me? Below, check out some very generous recommendations I've received as well as my skills, experience, and education.</p>
